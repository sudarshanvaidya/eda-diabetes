# eda-diabetes

(My first Exploratory Data Analysis using Python on Pima-Indian Diabetes data set)

Some time back, I tried my hands on the small Pima-Indian Diabetes data set, my first EDA using Python. 

What I have tried: 
explore the distributions, correlations, outliers, missing values etc. 
do univariate and bivariate analysis with multitude of plots
update the data set to take care of missing values and / or outliers
create correlation maps for different data set versions and correlation heat maps 
provided real world interpretation for each plot
