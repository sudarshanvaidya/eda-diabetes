# eda-diabetes

(My first Exploratory Data Analysis using Python on Pima-Indian Diabetes data set)

Some time back, I tried my hands on the small Pima-Indian Diabetes data set, my first EDA using Python. I have tried to explore the distributions, correlations, outliers, missing values etc. I have done univariate and bivariate analysis with multitude of plots, along with real world iterpretation for each plot.
