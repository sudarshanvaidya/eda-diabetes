# eda-diabetes

This is my first Exploratory Data Analysis using Python on Pima-Indian Diabetes data set 

What I have tried: 

1. Explore the distributions, correlations, outliers, missing values etc. 

2. Do univariate and bivariate analysis with multitude of plots

3. Update the data set to take care of missing values and / or outliers

4. Create correlation maps for different data set versions and correlation heat maps 

5. provided real world interpretation for each plot
